        "value": "<h2>Cost: 1 Hero Point per 10 Hero Points</h2><p>You have a pet or a sidekick. Every Hero Point you spend on this Perk gives you 10 Hero Points to create this character. Your companion can’t have more than half your Hero Points, and they must abide by the game’s Trait Cap. Your companion earns 1 Hero Point for every 2 that you earn. Pets and sidekicks are considered Heroes. They lack Resolve, but you can spend your Resolve on their behalf. If your companion has higher Trait ranks than you, use their Traits when determining your Resolve (see Chapter 5). If your companion has Flaws, you earn Resolve as if that character were a Hero. GMs who don’t want players running two (or more) characters should feel free to limit or prohibit this Perk.</p>",
