Unlike fame, which makes people like you, this Perk means you have authority, credibility, or respect in a particular arena. For example, in your civilian life, you might be an attorney known to be an absolute terror in the courtroom. If you have a secret identity, you must decide whether this Perk applies to your civilian identity or your heroic alter ego.</p>",
