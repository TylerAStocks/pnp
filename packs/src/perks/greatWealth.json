Not only can you buy whatever you want, but you can spend 1 point of Resolve once per issue to make a truly absurd purchase like buying an island or a major corporation. While many Heroes are wealthy, GMs may want to restrict Great Wealth because characters with this much money can spend their way around most problems without batting an eye.</p>",
